# Geeks for geeks Puzzle
1. An employee works for an employer for 7 days. The employer has a gold rod of 7 units. How does the employer pay to the employee, so that the number of employee’s rod units increases by one at the end of each day? The employer can make at most 2 cuts in the rod. 

(Hint- after the end of the day employee’s can’t spend any part of rod)

rod divided into three part = 1, 2, 4
first day given = 1;
second day given= 2 , withdrawel = 1;
third day give = 2+1; withdrawel = 0;
fourth day  given = 4 ; withdrawel = 2,1
fifth day given = 4 + 1 ; withdrawel = 0
sixth day given = 4 +2 ; withdrawel = 1
sevent hday given = 4 +2 +1 ; withdrawel = 0

2. There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct a race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point, you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out the minimum no. of races which are required to get the top 3 horses.

Race 1 = a1,b1,c1,d1,e1 
Race 2 = a2,b2,c2,d2,e2 
Race 3 = a3,b3,c3,d3,e3 
Race 4 = a4,b4,c4,d4,e4 
Race 5 = a5,b5,c5,d5,e5
Suppose fastest three of each group :-
    a1,b1,c1,d1,e1 
    a2,b2,c2,d2,e2
    a3,b3,c3,d3,e3

Race 6 = a1,b1,c1,d1,e1
a1>b1>c1>d1>e1
Remaining 
    a1,b1,c1
    a2,b2,c2
    a3,b3,c3
a1 is fastest 
Race 7 = a2 , a3 , b1,b2 ,c1

fastest 3 = a1 , a2 , a3

3. There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs inside the room. Outside the room, there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can’t change them. All bulbs are in working condition and you can open the door only once. Identify each switch with respect to its bulb.

Let the bulbs a,b,c and swithces x,y,z

A person turns on switch X, causing one of the bulbs to light up. They wait for some time to allow the bulb to warm up.

Afterward, the person turns off switch X and turns on switch Y, ensuring that another bulb lights up.
The person opens the gate and observes the bulbs. If one bulb is lit, they identify it as linked to the currently turned-on switch (switch Y).

Next, they check for a bulb that is warm but not lit, determining that this bulb was linked to the previously turned-on switch (switch X).

Finally, the remaining bulb, which is neither lit nor warm, is identified as connected to the switch that hasn’t been turned on yet.

4. A person has 3000 bananas and a camel. The person wants to transport the maximum number of bananas to a destination which is 1000 KMs away, using only the camel as a mode of transportation. The camel cannot carry more than 1000 bananas at a time and eats a banana every km it travels. What is the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred to the destination using only camel (no other mode of transportation is allowed). 

Solution :
    a. No of camel = 1
    b. No of bananas = 3000
    c. Camel can only carry 1000 bananas at a time
    d. camel eat a banana at every km

5. You are blindfolded and 10 coins are placed in front of you on the table. You are allowed to touch the coins but can’t tell which way up they are by feel. You are told that there are 5 coins head up, and 5 coins tails up but not which ones are which. 

Can you make two piles of coins each with the same number of heads up? You can flip the coins any number of times.
